### swift:

[Package.swift - Manual](http://blog.krzyzanowskim.com/2016/08/09/package-swift-manual/): Here is documentation for SPM manifest file Package.swift. I couldn't find a list of possible configuration values for Package.swift, so I created one, for future reference. I put here all available settings, with examples of use.

[Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)](https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/): This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), referred to as HTTP version 2 (HTTP/2). HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients.
This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.
